# Smasher9000
This is a dump of an old cricket harvesting machine prototype code repo for EntoCube. The core functionality of the harvester is demonstrated by the gif below. The code in the repo implements this functionality across a range of ARM-based boards (Arduino&custom), along with extra features such as safety limit switches, user input etc.
